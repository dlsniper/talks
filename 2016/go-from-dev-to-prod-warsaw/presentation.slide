* Agenda

Areas to consider when you before running your (Go) app to production:

- Logging
- Build
- Testing
- Benchmarking and profiling
- Deploying
- Monitoring


* Logging


* Logging

Log useful information:

- file and line number
- machine readable format preferably (structured)
- log the context in which an error happened
- log to stdout and stderr OR syslog
- don't spam your production logs (use info/error levels)

* Logging

Unstructured (free form) log example:

  [info] file.go:42 processing request 1 for dlsniper ...

Structured log examples:

  type=info location=file.go:42 request_id=1 user_name=dlsniper ...

  {"type": "info", "location": "file.go:42" "request_id": 1, "user_name": "dlsniper" ... }


* Logging

Choose a library that fits your project style / preference.

There are lots of good options.

A few popular libraries:

- structured: [[https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log][go-kit/kit/log]], [[https://godoc.org/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus][logrus]], [[https://godoc.org/github.com/inconshreveable/log15][log15]]
- unstructured: [[https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/glog][glog]], [[https://godoc.org/log][log]]


* Building a Go app


* Building the app

- managing dependencies
- testing
- building


* Dependency management in Go

Vendoring:

- copy a dependency in "vendor/" and maintain the package import path
  the library: github.com/dlsniper/demo

  imported as: import "github.com/dlsniper/demo"

  vendored as: projectRootDir/vendor/github.com/dlsniper/demo
- introduced as experimental feature of Go 1.5, here to stay from 1.7

Caveat: do not vendor if you are a writing a library


* Dependency management in Go

A few vendoring tools:

- godep
- gb
- glide
- govendor
- gvt
- ...

*** many more out there


* Dependency management in Go

Working with dependencies:

- treat dependencies as you treat your code
- always build the same thing on your machine as well as a CI system
- commit your "vendor/" folder
- go get doesn't understand versioning yet
- tag your releases


* Dependency management in Go

Even when Go will have a package manager, it doesn't mean we can now start:

- building a complex dependency tree
- skip reading the dependency code
- use outdated dependencies
- trust the dependency source


* Testing apps


* Black box testing

We have a package called demo in demo.go

  package demo

  func Add(x, y int) int {
      return x + y
  }

A black box test for it would be demo_test.go

  package demo_test

  import "demo"

  func TestAddWorks(t *testing.T) {
      result := demo.Add(1, 1)
      if result != 2 {
          t.Errorf("calling demo.Add(1, 1) returned %d not 2", result)
      }
  }


* Documentation testing

Test documentation with testable examples. In examples_test.go add the following

  package demo_test

  import "demo"

  func ExampleHello() {
          result := demo.Add(1, 1)
          // Output: result = 2
  }


* Building


* Building a Go app

Build a statically linked, no CGO, Linux/amd64 versioned app:

  CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 \
  go build \
    -tags netgo \
    -installsuffix netgo \
    -ldflags "-X main.version=${VERSION}" \
    -o binaryName \
   full/package/import/path

*** Be aware of the differences in DNS resolvers between the Go and CGO one.

Why is it useful to tag (version) your release:

  {"type": "info", "version": "abcd1234...", "location": "file.go:42" "request_id": 1, \
   "user_name": "dlsniper" ... }


* Benchmarking and profiling


* Benchmarking and profiling

Common situations:

- OMG GC! It's going to be slow
- I think / know <something> is going to be slow
- what's the fastest way to do <something>?


* Benchmarking and profiling

Which one is faster?

.code demo_test.go


* Benchmarking and profiling

* Benchmarking and profiling

Profile CPU:

    go test -bench . -benchtime 1m demo_test.go

    BenchmarkSprint-8       500000000              183 ns/op
    BenchmarkSprintf-8      1000000000              95.7 ns/op
    PASS
    ok      command-line-arguments   213.471s

Profile memory:

    go test -bench . -benchmem -memprofilerate=1 -benchtime 1m demo_test.go

    BenchmarkSprint-8       50000000              5245 ns/op              21 B/op          2 allocs/op
    BenchmarkSprintf-8      50000000              1495 ns/op               5 B/op          1 allocs/op
    PASS
    ok      command-line-arguments  340.888s


* Benchmarking and profiling

How to address performance issues:

- make changes
- profile OR monitor
- repeat until satisfied
- include benchmarks as part of your CI pipeline

  package demo_test

  import "demo"

  func BenchmarkQuickAdd(b *testing.B) {
      for i:=0; i<b.N; i++ {
            demo.Add(i, 0)
      }
  }

* Benchmarking and profiling

There are better ways to speed up your code:

- does it matter as often as you think it does?
- when it matters
- where it matters
- the fastest code is not to run any code (-1 allocs)

* Deployment


* Deployment

- there is no "The one true way of deploying Go"
- don't deploy your sources, deploy artifacts
- Go runs almost everywhere


* Raspberry Pi cluster

* Containers

Common practices:

- use Scratch, Alpine or Busybox as base image if possible
- don't ship your sources in production via containers, ship artifacts


* Tracing and Monitoring


* Tracing

Allows you to follow the execution of requests across services.

Client libraries:
- [[https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/tracing/opentracing][go-kit/tracing/opentracing]], [[https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/trace][x/net/trace]]

Server:
- [[https://github.com/tracer/tracer][Tracer - github.com/tracer/tracer]]


* Monitoring

Simple monitoring for local / test apps: [[https://github.com/divan/expvarmon][divan/expvarmon]]

Monitoring servers written in Go:
- [[https://prometheus.io/][Prometheus - https://prometheus.io]]
- [[http://snap-telemetry.io][Snap - http://snap-telemetry.io]]


* Wrap up

- vendoring guarantees dependencies will always be there
- building and deploying are simple enough to be adapted to existing systems
- don't assume anything about performance until you profile it
- fastest code is the one that doesn't need to run
- log what is important, trace and monitor everything else
